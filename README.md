# musictube
python 3.6

I want to download music from youtube, figured i can make a gui/api to make it easier.

The API works with a text file full of youtube links that are looked at and downloaded one at a time.

using youtube_dl module to do the heavy lifting; I'm just made a wrapper around that to make my life simple

does not support playlists for now, just individual links 

meant for personal use so I haven't tested on other machines ( works on my linux ).
