# musictube

I want to download music from youtube, figured i can make a gui to make it easier.

The API works with a text file full of youtube links that are looked at and downloaded one at a time.

using youtube_dl module to do the heavy lifting; I'm just making it look 'preety'

This (musictube) does not support youtube playlists for now, just individual links 

This is meant for personal use so there I haven't tested on other machines ( works on linux ).
